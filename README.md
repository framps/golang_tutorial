# Some sample files for a go tutorial

All samples can be run on a Raspberry Pi and all run on any system with one exception: trafficLight uses GPIOs which are available on a Raspberry Pi only.

1. blinkAllLEDs - sample which turns on and off LEDs connected to RaspberryPi GPIOs
2. functions - sample for go functions
3. geoLocationSunriseSunset - sample using go http client to retrieve the lattitude and longitude of a passed location and calculation of the local
4. gofunc - go functions used to demonstrate the dining philosophers problem using goroutines, channels and mutex
5. helloWorld - simple Hello world program
6. highLow - simple high/low game on command window level
7. highLowGameServer - simple high/low game server using templates and go http server. IBM Bluemix artefacts to deploy the server on bluemix are included
8. httpsServer - sample go https server which uses TLS and generates a self signed certificate
9. interfaces - Sample code which demonstrates go interfaces  
10. ipLocation - retrieve location information about the current used IP address via REST call sunrise and sunset time via REST calls
11. methods - Sample go code which demonstrates usage om methods
12. trafficLight - simple traffix light simulation using channels and go routines. Can be used on Raspberry when LEDs are connected to GPIOs
13. types - sampels for the different types in go
14. utf8 - sample for utf8 handling in go
